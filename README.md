- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicholas Ifeajika - @cybermind-nick
- 👀 I’m interested in alogrithm design and machine learning, computational science, graphics, cryptography, distributed systems and networking (A lot, I know; but I'm greedy)
- 🌱 I’m currently upskilling in ML, and exploring embedded systems and low-level programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects at the intersection of distributed systems and algorithm design...
- 📫 You can reach me through email -- nickifeajika@protonmail.com or nickifeajika@gmail.com
